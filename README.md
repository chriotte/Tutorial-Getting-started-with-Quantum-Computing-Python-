# Tutorial: Getting started with Quantum Computing (Python)

Quantum computers might sound a bit exotic and far into the future, but in reality, they are now accessible in the cloud or through emulators for everyone to write quantum code. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll go through how you can program a simple quantum computer to generate random numbers.

Code described in the accompanying [tutorial](http://dataespresso.com/en/2018/07/22/Tutorial-Generating-random-numbers-with-a-quantum-computer-Python/) at [DataEspresso.com](http://dataespresso.com/en/2018/07/22/Tutorial-Generating-random-numbers-with-a-quantum-computer-Python/)
